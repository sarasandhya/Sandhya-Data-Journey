# 🚀 Sandhya's Data Journey

Hi 👋, I'm Sandhya — a Data Engineering Analyst passionate about building real-world solutions using Data.

This repository is my **professional portfolio and personal growth story** —  
a place where I turn lessons from life and work into SQL projects, Python scripts, Cloud experiments, and dashboards.

## 💡 About This Space
I created this space to not only showcase my technical skills,  
but to also reflect my journey: growing through challenges, learning with consistency, and aiming to make a mark in the world of data and beyond.

Every project here is a small step toward a bigger dream. 🌱✨

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `SQL-Projects/` → Real-world SQL queries from Life Sciences, Sales, and Event Management domains.

## 🚀 Skills Showcased
- SQL | Python | Databricks | AWS | Power BI | Data Engineering Foundations | (DevOps coming soon 😉)

---

I'm constantly learning, evolving, and building.  
Thank you for visiting my journey-in-progress! 🌸
